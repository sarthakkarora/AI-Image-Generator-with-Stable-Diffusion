## **Getting Started**

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### **Prerequisites**
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Node.js 16+**  
- **npm**  
- A **CUDA-enabled GPU** (recommended but not required for CPU fallback support).

### **Backend Setup**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable-diffusion-image-generator.git
   cd stable-diffusion-image-generator
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Your React app will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## **Usage**
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running:
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (React app).
2. Select a prompt from the dropdown menu or enter a custom prompt.
3. Adjust parameters such as **guidance scale**, **steps**, and **resolution** for the desired image output.
4. Click **Generate Images** to create the images.
5. Download your generated images by clicking the download button.

## **Folder Structure**
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Backend logic (Flask)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ generated_images/     # Folder for storing generated images

â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
```

## **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure certain parameters:
```env
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development

# Model configuration
MODEL_NAME=stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large
DEVICE=cuda  # Options: cuda, cpu
```

### **Explanation of Environment Variables:**
- `MODEL_NAME`: The model checkpoint for Stable Diffusion.
- `DEVICE`: Specifies whether the model runs on GPU (`cuda`) or CPU (`cpu`).

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Out of Memory Errors**:
- Reduce the **image resolution** or **batch size** in the settings.
- Use a GPU with more VRAM or switch to CPU (though slower).

### **CORS Issues**:
- Ensure the Flask server (`http://127.0.0.1:5000`) is running.
- Make sure the React app is correctly configured to interact with this URL for API requests.

### **Flask Server Not Starting**:
- Check for any missing dependencies with `pip freeze`.
- Ensure no other services are using port 5000.

### **Frontend Issues**:
- If the React app is not loading, ensure that it's running on the correct port (`http://localhost:3000`).
- Check the developer console for any errors related to API calls or components.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Higher-Resolution Images**: Support for images with larger resolutions and tiling techniques for even better quality.
- **User Profiles & History**: Allow users to save and track generated images.
- **Image Customization**: Implement features like image upscaling, watermarking, or applying additional filters.
- **Advanced UI/UX**: Introduce an even more polished UI with enhanced responsiveness and user experience.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Integrate the ability for users to fine-tune the model with their custom datasets.
